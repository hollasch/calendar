Calendar
====================================================================================================

This is just a simple calendar utility I wrote a long time ago. At the moment, I'm using it to learn
CMake for cross-platform c++ development.

To build on Windows:

```
@ mkdir build

@ pushd build
@ cmake .. -G "NMake Makefiles"
@ popd

@ cmake --build build
```
